# Release History

### Version: v7.6 [20-Aug-2026]

Added:
* Write coverage extended to the remaining master types, so that every master which can be created from the Tally screen can now be created from the MCP client. New tools **company-create-update**, **stock-category-create-update**, **voucher-type-create-update**, **currency-create-update**, **gst-classification-create-update**, **budget-create-update** and the payroll trio **pay-head-create-update**, **employee-create-update** and **attendance-type-create-update**
* Tool **voucher-create-update** now supports **Stock Journal** and **Manufacturing Journal** through sourceEntries (consumption) and destinationEntries (production), which Tally expects as separate inventory lists and which the earlier single inventory list could not express
* Collection definition of **Currency**, **GSTClassification**, **AttendanceType**, **Employee** and **Budget**, making them queryable through query-collection and list-master

Fixed:
* Tool **list-master** offered collections (attendancetype, currency, gstclassification, gstin) which had no definition behind them and always answered *Invalid collection name*, while stockcategory was missing from the list despite being supported. The list is now derived from the collection definitions, so the two can no longer drift apart
* Version reported to the MCP client was hard-coded as 7.0.0 since v7, which made it impossible to tell from the client which build was actually running. It is now read from package.json of the deployment

### Version: v7.5 [10-Aug-2026]

Added:
* **Write-back to Tally** extended well beyond ledger creation. New tools **group-create-update**, **stock-group-create-update**, **stock-item-create-update**, **unit-create-update**, **godown-create-update**, **cost-category-create-update** and **cost-centre-create-update** cover the remaining master types, while **voucher-create-update** and **voucher-delete** allow transactions (payment, receipt, contra, journal, sales, purchase, credit note, debit note, delivery note, receipt note) to be created, altered and deleted. Voucher input supports bill wise allocation, cost centre allocation, godown and batch allocation and invoice style accounting allocation of inventory
* Tool **ledger-create-update** now accepts email, mobile number, bank details (account number / IFSC), cost centre applicability and a multi-line mailing address
* Collection definition of **CostCategory** and **CostCentre**, which makes them queryable through query-collection and list-master tools
* Add many fields into collection definition to make query-collection even more robust
* Introduced feature of blocking access to Write functionality tool as discussed in [#26](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/26) by introduction of environment variable BLOCK_WRITE
* MCP was unable to connect to tally running of PC other than local, as localhost was hard-coded in Tally Host setting. Based on suggestion for improvement in [#25](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/25) environment variable TALLY_HOST was introduced to allow setting of IP address to connect Tally running on different computer

Fixed:
* Failures reported by Tally during an import (LINEERROR / ERRORS / EXCEPTIONS inside the response envelope) were being swallowed and reported as a success with zero counts. These are now surfaced back with the exact message returned by Tally
* Tool errors were serialized using JSON.stringify on an Error instance, which produced an empty object hiding the reason of failure. Errors now carry a readable message
* GSTIN of ledger-create-update was validated against a date pattern, due to which GST registration details could never be pushed. Mailing address supplied to the same tool was silently dropped as the XML template never emitted it
* Master name supplied for renaming was not being XML escaped, breaking the request when the name carried characters like &amp;
* Names of masters referred by a voucher are validated (case-insensitively) against Tally before the write is attempted, and vouchers which do not balance or whose bill / cost centre allocations do not add up are rejected upfront with a precise message instead of being partially imported
* Environment variable BLOCK_WRITE now accepts **true** and **yes** apart from **1**, and is exposed as the *Block Write Access* switch of the Claude Desktop extension
* House-keeping task like upgrading of depedencies (node packages)
* Improvement in the documentation

### Version: v7.4 [03-Jul-2026]

Added:
* Tool delete-master introduce to delete master type collection [#14](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/14)

Fixed:
* Date was being shifted by 1 day due to UTC offset. Fixed applied addressing issue [#23](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/23)

### Version: v7.3 [31-May-2026]

Fixed:
* Tool query-collection was crashing Tally instance when the all of the fields requested did not exists in Tally, due to which bad Tally XML request was being generated, which is fixed in https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/pull/20

### Version: v7.2 [13-May-2026]

Added:
* Bundled version of Tally MCP Server for Claude Desktop i.e. Extension, for one-click installation

### Version: v7.1 [13-May-2026]

Fixed:
* Internal TDL syntax in XML request were breaking when double quote was specified in input for tools, which is now escaped properly
* Faulty handling for 0 and blank string is fixed
* In v7 tool chart-of-accounts was modified to extract only group, due to which response cycle was getting longer consuming more tokens. This behavious is reverted back to orginal
* In tool **ledger-account** field displaying alternate ledger is introduced, since party name field is found empty for journal type vouchers

### Version: v7 [12-May-2026]

Added:
* Tools **set-period** and **set-company** which can act as extra safeguard if user wants to set it as default for subsequent tool calls
* Tool **query-collection** to quickly query various fields of collection dynamically for ad-hoc information gathering [#11](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/11)
* Tools **metadata-collection** and **metadata-fields** to be used as helper functionality to gather listing of available collections and their fields for *query-collection* tool
* Tool **query-option-values** to gather listing of drop-down values from Tally for various data-entry screens [#12](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/12)
* Tool **ledger-create-update** to create or update ledger(s) on-the-fly in Tally [#7](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/7)

Fixed:
* Database of in-memory query was changed from **DuckDB** to **PgLite** for better cross-platform experience. Justification behind this change was increasing adoption of this MCP server in Mac OS [[#10](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/10)]
* Migrated many reports to use tool query-collection internally to reduce static XML templates. As a result many of XML template files are now removed in favour of internal tool call. Reports are left only for few tools which have complex TDL expression which is difficult to accommodate in query collection functionality.
* Tool usage for reports were found to be reading template file from disk for every tool call. Caching of these templates was implemented by storing minified XML of these template in key-value variables [#13](https://github.com/dhananjay1405/tally-mcp-server/issues/13)
* TSV (Tab Separated Value) format was facing issue for few AI agents, which are designed to work only with JSON output. TSV has been removed in favour of introduction of 4 output format CSV, Markdown, JSON Array of Objects, JSON Schema and Rows

### Version: v6 [11-Nov-2025]

Added:
* Introducing of DuckDB based in-memory database caching of tabular output into temporary table (which persists for 15 min), for quick and accurate aggregation, filtering, sorting, calculation (which LLM is not capable of). This feature helps to do away with context size limitation of LLM for MCP output, which often produced error or hallucination. LLM now smartly handles by using SQL query to get this done.

Fixed:
* Renaming of column names for better readability and SQL querying by MCP
* Fixed few prompt description
* Amount was coming as 0 for *ledger-account* tool for few scenario, is now fixed by relevant XML TDL expression changes
* Quantity fetched by *stock-item-balance* tool was in absolute number ignoring negative balance scenario, is fixed by applying changes to XML
* Debit / Credit total in *trial-balance* tool was suppose to be positive for net Debit or net Credit respetively, is now fixed by applying changes on XML

### Version: v5 [06-Nov-2025]

Added:
* Stock Item Account tool

Fixed:
* ledger-account tool was ignoring Debit / Credit sign for opening balance. XML was fixed to prefix Dr / Cr sign


### Version: v4 [30-Oct-2025]

Added:
* Ease of configuration of setting via **.env** file instead of environment variables
* Balance Sheet and Profit Loss tools

Fixed:
* Ability to fetch from specific targetCompany was not working, which is now fixed
* ledger-account tool was skipping vouchers for some scenario. XML was fixed to query it and optimize it further as per Tally Solution TDL blog for best practise
* Unnecessary XML files used during initial development phase were removed


### Version: v3 [09-Oct-2025]

Added:
* Tool **chart-of-accounts** to grab group hierarchy structure
* Tool **stock-summary** to pull summary of all stock items with opening / inward / outward / closing values of quantity and amount

Fixed:
* Revamped MCP code to enhance connectivity with ChatGPT
* Minor fixes in Tally XML handling
* Tool **ledger-account** was skipping opening balance, which is not added into it
* Converted output of all the possible tools to tab separated format for optimization and light-weight response


### Version: v2 [04-Oct-2025]

Added:
* Tool **ledger-account** to grab ledger account
* Support for **ChatGPT** platform remote MCP

Fixed:
* oAuth implementation was revamped to adhere better to specification 2.1. These fixes allowed ChatGPT connectivity.
* Tabular response format was changed from JSON (which is heavy) to tab-separated for optimization. This allowed fitting of more data in response context.
* CLIENT_SECRET term was mistakenly used in entire code base, which was renamed as PASSWORD which is precise description of it.


### Version: v1 [02-Sep-2025]

Added:
* Entire implementation of Local &amp; Remote MCP
